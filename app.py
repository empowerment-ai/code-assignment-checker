        # AI-based Programming Assignment Reviewer

        Welcome to this AI-powered tool designed to assist educators in evaluating general programming assignments. This application utilizes the capabilities of [LangChain](https://github.com/LangChain/langchain) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com) to automate the review process of student submissions, helping to ensure consistency and efficiency in assessment. This tool currently requires a OpenAI API Key, which can be obtained using the provided link.   While it is not free, the OpenAI models provide the best results and overall the [cost](https://openai.com/pricing#language-models) per check is minimal.  Rever to the OpenAI website for details.

        ## How it Works
        The tool parses the student submissions and uses AI to run tests and evaluate the code quality against specified criteria. By integrating LangChain and OpenAI, we can leverage advanced natural language processing to interpret the code's intent and provide detailed feedback.

        ## Features
        - **Automated Code Execution**: Run student programs safely in an isolated environment.
        - **Code Quality Analysis**: Evaluate code for best practices and adherence to programming standards.
        - **Feedback Generation**: Automatically generate constructive feedback based on the code analysis.

        ## Get Started
        To begin, simply review or tweak the AI instructions, copy/paste your assignment instructions, and an individual student's coding submission. Once you are done, you can click the Check button to match the submission against the instructions.

        ## Caveats
        This does not replace the need to review the student's work.  While the plan is to improve this tool, AI will generate hallucination. You may need to tweak the AI instructions to improve the generated feedback.
